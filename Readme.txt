Version 3_Not Scaled
--------------------

1. This program can be scaled for the given material stress-strain curve.
2. Currently, mapped with LSS32 for 200 X 200
3. Percolation porosity - site percolation.
4. It is correct way of introducing porosity.
5. Extract few information - coordination number, pore distribution, crack pattern analysis, etc.
